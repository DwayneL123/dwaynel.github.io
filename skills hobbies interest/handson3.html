    <h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I'm now 20 years old and I still don't know what my skills are.<sup
        >1</sup>
      Maybe being a hard worker is my skill? Is that even a skill?<sup>2</sup> I
      don't have anything particular that I'm good at, maybe I'm mediocre at
      best on things that I do.<sup>3</sup> I have a basic understanding of
      computer programming and I have decent knowledge about computer
      hardware.<sup>4</sup> I have leadership skills, as I can take initiative
      and guide others when needed.<sup>5</sup> I have problem-solving abilities
      and willingness to learn.<sup>6</sup> I think one of my skills is critical
      thinking.<sup>7</sup> I can analyze situations logically and make
      well-informed decisions.<sup>8</sup> I don't just accept information at
      face value, I like to question things and break them down to understand
      how they work.<sup>9</sup> Whether it's troubleshooting a technical issue
      or evaluating different solutions to a problem, I try to think critically
      to find the best possible outcome.<sup>10</sup> I also have good
      communication skills, it allows me to express my thoughts clearly and
      collaborate effectively with others.<sup>11</sup> I also have decent
      gaming skills because of the allotted time I played the game. Sometimes
      while playing games, I feel like I'm so good at it.<sup>12</sup> Sometimes
      I feel like I suck.<sup>13</sup> I am detail-oriented, making sure to pay
      attention to small but important aspects of a task.<sup>14</sup> Even
      though I sometimes feel like I'm not particularly skilled in any one area,
      I know that my ability to learn and improve will help me develop my
      strengths over time.<sup>15</sup> Maybe I just need more experience to
      truly realize what I'm capable of.<sup>16</sup> I will continue to expand
      my skill set and also improve my existing skills.<sup>17</sup> Another
      skill I have is creativity.<sup>18</sup> I enjoy thinking outside the box
      and coming up with new ideas.<sup>19</sup> I know how to play the guitar,
      which allows me to express myself through music.<sup>20</sup>

    <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      Hobbies, I have a lot of hobbies throughout my life.<sup>1</sup> I watched
      shows in my free time since I was a kid, and I still do it whenever I want
      to relax.<sup>2</sup> I played basketball when I was little, but now I
      rarely play it.<sup>3</sup> I also like playing games, whether it's an
      online game or a physical game.<sup>4</sup> I got absorbed by playing
      online games, and that's also part of the reason why I chose an I.T.
      course.<sup>5</sup> I got curious about how games are made, and I also
      would like to make my own games in the future.<sup>6</sup> I also loved
      drawing when I was a kid.<sup>7</sup> I used to sketch random things in my
      notebook, and sometimes, I would even try to copy characters from my
      favorite shows.<sup>8</sup> I enjoyed reading books, especially adventure
      and fantasy stories, because they allowed me to imagine different
      worlds.<sup>9</sup> Although I don't read as much now, I still appreciate
      a good story.<sup>10</sup> I also tried learning how to play the guitar,
      but I never got too serious about it.<sup>11</sup> Still, I find music
      enjoyable, and I listen to it for hours, especially when I need to focus
      or just want to clear my mind.<sup>12</sup> Video editing is something I
      got into as well.<sup>13</sup> I like experimenting with different
      effects, transitions, and audio to make my videos more engaging.<sup
        >14</sup
      >
      Designing is another thing I enjoy, which is why I like using Canva to
      create simple posters, thumbnails, and other visuals.<sup>15</sup> I also
      tried cooking.<sup>16</sup> I find it fun to experiment with different
      recipes.<sup>17</sup> Though I'm not an expert, I like the process of
      making food and trying new flavors.<sup>18</sup> There are times when I
      just enjoy doing nothing, simply lying down and letting my mind
      wander.<sup>19</sup> Even though I have a lot of hobbies, I always find
      myself going back to playing games because it's something I never get
      tired of.<sup>20</sup>

    <h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>
    <p>
      My interest in things varies from what I'm doing at the point of my
      life.<sup>1</sup> When I was in high school, I was interested in joining
      our drum and lyre band in our school.<sup>2</sup> After I joined, I was
      interested in drumming and getting better and better.<sup>3</sup> When I
      was in grade school, my interest was towards anime and learning
      Japanese.<sup>4</sup> I used to watch a lot of anime and even tried to
      memorize common Japanese phrases.<sup>5</sup> When I was in high school,
      my interest was in online games like League of Legends because it was so
      fun to play.<sup>6</sup> I spent a lot of time playing with friends, and I
      enjoyed the competition and strategy involved.<sup>7</sup> As I got older,
      my interests changed.<sup>8</sup> I started becoming curious about video
      editing and graphic design.<sup>9</sup> I enjoyed making simple edits and
      trying out different styles.<sup>10</sup> I also got interested in coding
      because I wanted to understand how games and websites are made.<sup
        >11</sup
      >
      I found it interesting how different lines of code could create something
      functional and interactive.<sup>12</sup> At some point, I got interested
      in going to the gym because I wanted to get stronger and be more
      active.<sup>13</sup> I enjoyed working out for a while, but eventually, I
      stopped.<sup>14</sup> I also got into playing the guitar.<sup>15</sup> I
      liked learning different chords and trying to play songs I enjoyed, but I
      never got too serious about it.<sup>16</sup> I also got into watching
      esports tournaments, especially for games that I play, because I like
      seeing high-level gameplay and learning from professionals.<sup>17</sup>
      At some point, I was also interested in creating content, like making
      gameplay videos or short edits, just for fun.<sup>18</sup> My interests
      always change depending on what I'm into at the moment, but I always enjoy
      learning new things and improving my skills.<sup>19</sup> No matter how
      much my interests change, I always find excitement in discovering
      something new to explore.<sup>20</sup>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dwayne Monty G. Leaño</b> is 20 years
          old and grew up in Antipolo City.<sup>1</sup> He grew up with his lolo
          and mama since his father was working abroad at that time.<sup>2</sup>
          When he was in kindergarten, he wouldn't agree to be left behind by
          his lolo, so his lolo was forced to stay in school to accompany
          him.<sup>3</sup> Most of the time, Dwayne played with his cousins from
          his mother's side.<sup>4</sup> When he was young, he used to have
          yayas.<sup>5</sup> They came and went due to circumstances on their
          end.<sup>6</sup> But when he grew up to 7 years old, the one who
          looked after him was his lolo.<sup>7</sup> His lolo would escort and
          fetch him from school since his mother came home from work at 7 in the
          evening.<sup>8</sup> His grade school days were filled with lots of
          fun.<sup>9</sup> He went to Our Lady of Peace School in grade school
          as well as junior high school.<sup>10</sup> He had a brother who was
          born when he was in grade 4 (2013).<sup>11</sup> They moved houses
          from their lolo's house to their own house when he was also in grade
          4.<sup>12</sup> Outside of school, he was active in playing around
          with his friends after moving to Kingsville Hills (his current home)
          when he was in grade 4.<sup>13</sup> He would constantly go home late
          from playing outside, enjoying all kinds of games with his friends
          like <i>Basketball, Patintero, Agawan Base, etc.</i><sup>14</sup> He
          also enjoyed biking around the neighborhood, racing with his friends
          on the streets until sunset.<sup>15</sup> During weekends, he would
          wake up early just to play outside, sometimes forgetting to eat
          breakfast because he was too excited.<sup>16</sup> But that would soon
          come to an end after discovering an online game called League of
          Legends.<sup>17</sup> He would try to download it on their family
          laptop, but it sucked since the specs couldn't handle the workload of
          the game.<sup>18</sup> Because of that, he would go to computer shops
          after school or on the weekends.<sup>19</sup> He would meet friends
          from school who also played the same game, who would also be his
          friends until now.<sup>20</sup>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his teenage years, after graduating
          from grade school, he continued studying at Our Lady of Peace School
          since his cousins also went there.<sup>1</sup> They were escorted to
          and picked up from school together by their lolo, who was mentioned
          earlier.<sup>2</sup> When he was in grade 7, he saw his cousin, whom
          he had played with since childhood, join the school's marching
          band.<sup>3</sup> He watched the drum and lyre band perform and was
          amazed and inspired to join as well.<sup>4</sup> But when he
          auditioned, he did not get accepted.<sup>5</sup> Since the band only
          held auditions once a year for new members, he had to wait another
          year to try again.<sup>6</sup> He was crushed because he had dreamed
          of performing with the band in front of a crowd. After a year, when he
          was in grade 8, he auditioned again and was accepted.<sup>7</sup> He
          was overjoyed, but he soon realized that being in the band was even
          harder than the audition. <sup>8</sup>His teenage years revolved
          around the band.<sup>9</sup> Although practices were exhausting and he
          often came home late from school, he enjoyed every moment.<sup
            >10</sup
          >
          When he reached grade 9, COVID-19 shocked the world. <sup>11</sup>His
          family suffered a huge loss when his lolo passed away due to the
          virus.<sup>12</sup> This was probably the lowest point of his
          life.<sup>13</sup> During the pandemic, his daily routine consisted of
          online classes and playing games with his friends.<sup>14</sup> His
          friends became his source of comfort, helping him get through tough
          times by making things more enjoyable.<sup>15</sup> Fast forward two
          years, he transferred to Antipolo Institute of Technology.<sup
            >16</sup
          >
          At first, he felt scared and uncomfortable since this was the first
          time in years that he was not surrounded by familiar faces from his
          old school.<sup>17</sup> However, because the tuition was free, as the
          school was government-sponsored, he decided to push through with the
          transfer.<sup>18</sup> Over time, he was able to find new friends and
          experience things he never would have in his previous school.<sup
            >19</sup
          >
          Looking back, he realizes that every challenge he faced helped shape
          him into the resilient and adaptable person he is today.<sup>20</sup>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduating from Antipolo Institute
          of Technology, he decided to enroll at the University of the East to
          pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>1</sup> He
          heard that UE offers quality education and chose to study there.<sup
            >2</sup
          >
          He compared the tuition fees of universities offering the same course
          and found that UE had the lowest tuition fee.<sup>3</sup> However, he
          was disappointed when he learned that tuition fees increase every
          year.<sup>4</sup> Since he is from Antipolo, his daily commute was
          long and exhausting.<sup>5</sup> During the first few weeks of school,
          he struggled and wondered if he could manage this routine for four
          years.<sup>6</sup> Over time, he got used to it and no longer minded
          the travel except, of course, when there was heavy traffic.<sup
            >7</sup
          >
          When he started at UE, he was able to invite an old friend from his
          previous school to join him.<sup>8</sup> He also had no trouble making
          new friends and acquaintances.<sup>9</sup> However, school was much
          harder than he expected.<sup>10</sup> The workload was overwhelming at
          times, and there were moments when he felt like giving up.<sup

          Sleepless nights became common as he juggled multiple projects,
          quizzes, and exams.<sup>12</sup> Despite the challenges, he remained
          determined and pushed through every obstacle.<sup>13</sup> He sought
          help from his classmates, managed his time better, and slowly adapted
          to the demands of college life.<sup>14</sup> Because of his hard work
          during his first semester in his first year, he earned a college
          scholarship.<sup>15</sup> However, in the following semesters, he fell
          just short of the required grade, narrowly missing the scholarship
          each time.<sup>16</sup> His perseverance paid off, and now, he is in
          his second year, more confident and prepared to take on whatever
          challenges come next.<sup>17</sup> Although he was unable to regain
          the scholarship, he remains motivated to do his best, hoping to
          achieve it again in the future.<sup>18</sup> He has also developed
          better study habits and learned to balance academics with personal
          time.<sup>19</sup> Looking ahead, he remains optimistic and determined
          to make the most of his college journey, aiming to excel in his field
          and achieve his long-term goals.<sup>20</sup>
